Description: A backwards/forwards-compatible fork of distutils.version.LooseVersion (Python 3)
 A backwards/forwards-compatible fork of distutils.version.LooseVersion, for times when PEP-440 isn't what you need.
 The goal of this package is to be a drop-in replacement for the original LooseVersion. It implements an identical interface and comparison logic to LooseVersion. The only major change is that a looseversion.LooseVersion is comparable to a distutils.version.LooseVersion, which means tools should not need to worry whether all dependencies that use LooseVersion have migrated.
 This package installs the library for Python 3.

Description: shared libraries that salt requires for all packages
 salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to
 administer servers in a fast and efficient way.
 .
 It allows commands to be executed across large groups of
 servers. This means systems can be easily managed, but data can
 also be easily gathered.  Quick introspection into running
 systems becomes a reality.
 .
 Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a
 remote system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt
 state system uses salt state files to define the state a server
 needs to be in.
 .
 Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt
 addresses the backbone of cloud and data center management.
 .
 This particular package provides shared libraries that
 salt-master, salt-minion, and salt-syndic require to function.
