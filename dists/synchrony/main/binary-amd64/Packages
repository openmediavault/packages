Description: shared libraries that salt requires for all packages
 salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to
 administer servers in a fast and efficient way.
 .
 It allows commands to be executed across large groups of
 servers. This means systems can be easily managed, but data can
 also be easily gathered.  Quick introspection into running
 systems becomes a reality.
 .
 Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a
 remote system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt
 state system uses salt state files to define the state a server
 needs to be in.
 .
 Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt
 addresses the backbone of cloud and data center management.
 .
 This particular package provides shared libraries that
 salt-master, salt-minion, and salt-syndic require to function.

Description: Python Web Services Discovery Daemon, Windows Net Browsing
 This daemon is used to announce Linux Hosts to Windows 7+ computers for
 use in their File Manager network browsing, by using the Windows
 Services Discovery Protocol.
 .
 This protocol is a local network segment procotol, which is multicasted
 on udp/3072, and incoming on tcp/5357 on the 239.255.255.250/ff02::c
 multicast addresses.  It DOES have security issues, but it is designed
 for use in a trusted environment inside a firewall.
 .
 Install only this if running Gnome desktop, or GVFS and not announcing
 well known File shares.  See wsdd-server for working with Samba servers.
